# Brain Buffs Tutoring 

**See the deployed site at https://www.brainbuffstutoring.com**

## Overview 

This will serve as a basic architechure overview of this site. I will outline the technologies used for each portion as well as point to relevant files to learn more. 

The site is run on top of AWS Services. It uses AWS Amplify for CI/CD, as well as hosting. The frontend of the site uses primarily ReactJS. The backend uses AWS Lambda serverless resolvers. 

## React 

The majority of the code is ReactJS. Most of the components are in the location
./src/components. The components are nested React components with lots of in component styling as well as use of React hooks.
