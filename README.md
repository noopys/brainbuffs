# Brain Buffs Tutoring 

**See the deployed site at https://www.brainbuffstutoring.com**

## Overview 

This will serve as a basic architecture overview of this site. I will outline the technologies used for each portion and point to relevant files to learn more. 


## AWS 
The site is run on top of AWS Services. It uses AWS Amplify for CI/CD, as well as hosting. The backend uses AWS Lambda serverless resolvers. 

## React 

The majority of the code is ReactJS. Most of the components are in the location
./src/components. The components are nested React components with lots of in-component styling as well as the use of React hooks.
